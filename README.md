## Dataset

The code utilizes the "diabetes.csv" dataset, which contains information about various health factors and whether or not an individual has diabetes. The dataset is loaded using the Pandas library.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd diabetes-prediction
   ```

3. Install the required libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
   ```

## Usage

1. Make sure you have the "diabetes.csv" dataset available. You can replace it with your own dataset or use the provided one.

2. Execute the Python script:

   ```bash
   python diabetes_prediction.py
   ```

3. The script will load the dataset, split it into training and testing sets, create a Logistic Regression model, train the model, and then evaluate its accuracy on the test data.

## Results

The accuracy of the trained Logistic Regression model on the test data is printed to the console.

```
Accuracy: 0.7532467532467533
```

You can further modify and optimize the model or dataset to improve prediction accuracy.
